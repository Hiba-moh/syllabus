## Recap

Last week we looked at using props and state to create React components that change with user input ([interactive example](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-3-state-recap-38x3b?file=/src/Counter.js)):

```js
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function increment() {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

## Fetching Data in React

Often when you create a React app, you will want to fetch data from an API and display it inside your components. How do we do this in React?

You might think that we could just fetch the data in the component like this, but unfortunately it **won't work** ([interactive example](https://codesandbox.io/s/async-data-fetching-in-react-not-working-fnfyu?file=/src/MartianPhotoFetcher.js:43-407)):

:::danger
This code won't work!
:::

```js
function MartianPhotoFetcher() {
  let imgSrc = null;

  fetch(
    `https://api.nasa.gov/mars-photos/api/v1/rovers/curiosity/photos?earth_date=2015-6-3&api_key=DEMO_KEY`
  )
    .then((res) => res.json())
    .then((data) => {
      imgSrc = data.photos[0].img_src;
    });

  console.log(`The image src is ${imgSrc}`);
  return <img src={imgSrc} />;
}
```

This is because React is synchronous, while `fetch` is asynchronous. If we look in the console, we'll see that the `imgSrc` will always be `null` when we try to render it. React will try to render before `fetch` has had time to get the data from the API.

<img alt="Timeline of React rendering before data returned from the API" src={require('!file-loader!../assets/data-fetching-timeline-problem.png').default}/>

We need a way of running the `fetch` call **after** we have rendered for the first time, so that it is not _racing_ against React updating the DOM. Then once we have got the data back we can use state to tell React to re-render with the new data.

<img alt="Timeline of React rendering before data returned from the API" src={require('!file-loader!../assets/data-fetching-timeline-solution.png').default}/>

The way we do this is with another Hook, provided by React. This one is called `useEffect`.

### Importing `useEffect`

Just like `useState`, we will import `useEffect` into our file like this ([interactive example](https://codesandbox.io/s/importing-useeffect-hook-mij5v?file=/src/App.js)):

```js
import React, { useEffect } from "react";

console.log(useEffect);
```

If we look in the console, we'll see that `useEffect` is also a function like `useState`.

Often, we will need to use `useState` and `useEffect` together. They are imported together like this:

```js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
```

### Using `useEffect`

Now let's look at how to use the `useEffect` Hook ([interactive example](https://codesandbox.io/s/basic-useeffect-example-jf6id?file=/src/HelloUseEffect.js)):

```js
function MartianPhotoFetcher() {
  useEffect(() => {
    fetch(
      `https://api.nasa.gov/mars-photos/api/v1/rovers/curiosity/photos?earth_date=2015-6-3&api_key=DEMO_KEY`
    )
      .then((res) => res.json())
      .then((data) => {
        console.log(data);
      });
  }, []); // Always remember to put an empty array here!

  return <div>Hello useEffect!</div>;
}
```

The `useEffect` Hook takes two arguments:

1. A callback function, where we can put our `fetch` call. In this example, we're fetching some data from the NASA API! ðŸš€
2. An array, which we'll look at later but is very important that you don't forget it!

:::tip
When writing your `useEffect`, write the "skeleton" first, then fill in the callback function later.

```js
// Write this bit first!
useEffect(() => {
  // Write this bit later!
}, []);
```

:::

You might have noticed that we still haven't rendered the data from the API. We now need to tell React to re-render once we get the data. This sounds like a job for state!

Let's look an example of how we can use state and `useEffect` to do this ([interactive example](https://codesandbox.io/s/using-the-useeffect-hook-jtz5u?file=/src/MartianPhotoFetcher.js)):

```js
function MartianPhotoFetcher() {
  const [marsPhotoData, setMarsPhotoData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch(
      `https://api.nasa.gov/mars-photos/api/v1/rovers/curiosity/photos?earth_date=2015-6-3&api_key=DEMO_KEY`
    )
      .then((res) => res.json())
      .then((data) => {
        setMarsPhotoData(data);
      });
  }, []);

  if (marsPhotoData) {
    return <img src={marsPhotoData.photos[0].img_src} alt="Martian surface" />;
  } else {
    return null;
  }
}
```

The timeline of this component is now what we wanted at the start: after the component has rendered the first time (this is sometimes called _mounting_), fetch data from the NASA API. When the response is received, update the state and re-render so that we can show the data on-screen.

| Exercise A (estimate: 15 min)                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Open the `pokedex` React application again.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 2. Create a new file `src/PokemonMoves.js`, and copy/paste the code from [this CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/pokemonmoves-useeffect-exercise-starting-point-f1mwm?file=/src/PokemonMoves.js).                                                      |
| 3. Render the `PokemonMoves` component inside the `App` component (underneath `CaughtPokemon`).                                                                                                                                                            |
| 4. Take a few minutes to read the code in the new `PokemonMoves` component. Discuss with another student why you think it doesn't work.                                                                                                                    |
| 5. Create a new state variable called `pokemonData` and initialise it to `null`. <details><summary>Click here if you are stuck.</summary>Check last week's lesson for a reminder on creating state variables.</details>                                    |
| 6. Now add a `useEffect` call, but leave the callback function empty for now. **Make sure you remember to add the empty array after the callback function**.                                                                                               |
| 7. Inside the `useEffect` callback, call the `fetch` function with this URL: `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/1/`.                                                                                                                                       |
| 8. Add a `.then` handler into the `fetch` function (remember this needs to come immediately after the `fetch` call) which converts the response from JSON (hint: `.then(res => res.json())`).                                                              |
| 9. Add a second `.then` handler after the one we just added, where the callback function will receive an argument called `data`.                                                                                                                           |
| 11. Within the second `.then` callback function, log out the data that we just received (hint: `console.log(data)`). Inspect the data in the dev tools console. Is there any interesting data? (Hint: think about what the component is trying to render). |
| 12. Still within the second `.then` callback, set the `pokemonData` state to be the `data` object we received from the API.                                                                                                                                |
| 13. What happens in your browser? Do you understand why? If not, discuss it with another student. If you are both stuck, ask a Teaching Assistant.                                                                                                         |

### Conditional rendering

In the `MartianPhotoFetcher` component above, we wrapped our JSX inside an `if` / `else` statement. This is common practice in React, as it allows us to show something different depending on the situation (for example if there is no data to display, show the user something else instead).

You may also see this done in 2 other ways:

#### The ternary operator `? :`

The _ternary operator_ follows this structure `condition ? outputIfTrue : outputIfFalse` ([interactive example](https://codesandbox.io/s/conditional-rendering-with-ternary-operator-tjro6?file=/src/MartianPhotoFetcher.js)):

```js
return (
  <div>
    {marsPhotoData ? (
      <img src={marsPhotoData.photos[0].img_src} alt="Martian surface" />
    ) : (
      <span>Loading...</span>
    )}
  </div>
);
```

#### The double ampersand `&&`

The double ampersand `&&` is used when you don't have an `else`. The implication is that when the condition is not fulfilled, nothing will render ([interactive example](https://codesandbox.io/s/conditional-rendering-with-double-ampersand-1b5t9?file=/src/MartianPhotoFetcher.js)):

```js
return (
  <div>
    {marsPhotoData && (
      <img src={marsPhotoData.photos[0].img_src} alt="Martian surface" />
    )}
  </div>
);
```

You'll notice in the `&&` example above, we do not render a 'Loading...' message, because there is no alternative output (no `else` case).

| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Open the `pokedex` application and the `src/PokemonMoves.js` file.                                                               |
| 2. Change the `if` / `else` statement in your JSX to use the ternary operator (`condition ? outputIfTrue : outputIfFalse`) instead. |

### The Circle of Life

We now know how to fetch data and render it in our React applications. However, there was a problem with the method that just learned. To understand this problem we first have to understand the _lifecycle_ of a component.

Let's take a look at an example:

| Exercise C (estimate: 10 min)                                                                                                             |
| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Open [this CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/fetch-with-prop-updates-not-working-x1dox?file=/src/App.js).                          |
| 2. Take 5 minutes to read the code.                                                                                                       |
| 3. Click the "Fetch image for 2019" button. **If you're feeling confident**: predict what is going to happen before you click the button. |
| 4. Now click the "Fetch image for 2020" button. What did you expect to happen? What actually happened? Can you explain why?               |

Together let's "play computer" to break down exactly what is happening with these components:

1. When the page loads, the `App` function component is called
2. It doesn't have any `date` state already, so we initialise it to an empty string (`""`) with `useState`
3. It renders the 2 buttons, but because `date` is an empty string, it does **not** render the `MartianImageFetcher` component. Instead `null` is returned, which means that nothing is rendered

```js
  function App() {
    const [date, setDate] = useState("");

    ...

    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={handle2019Click}>Fetch image for 2019</button>
        <button onClick={handle2020Click}>Fetch image for 2020</button>

        {date ? <MartianImageFetcher photoDate={date} /> : null}
      </div>
    );
  }
```

4. When we click the "Fetch image for 2019" button, the `handle2019Click` click handler is called
5. The state is set by `setDate` to be `"2019-01-01"`, and a re-render is triggered
6. The `App` function component is called again
7. This time, `useState` remembers that we have `date` state and it is set to `"2019-01-01"`

```js
  function App() {
    ...

    function handle2019Click() {
      setDate("2019-01-01");
    }

    ...

    return (
      ...
      <button onClick={handle2019Click}>Fetch image for 2019</button>
      ...
    );
  }
```

8. Now `App` **does** render `MartianImageFetcher` and passes the `date` state as a prop named `photoDate`
9. The `MartianImageFetcher` function component is called for the first time
10. `useState` knows that we haven't got any `imgSrc` state so initialises it to `null`
11. We queue an effect, which will run after we render for the first time
12. Because the `imgSrc` state is set to `null`, we return `null`. This means that nothing is rendered

```js
  function MartianImageFetcher(props) {
    const [imgSrc, setImgSrc] = useState(null);

    useEffect(() => {
      ...
    }, []);

    if (!imgSrc) {
      return null;
    } else {
      return <img src={imgSrc} />;
    }
  }
```

13. Now that the component has rendered for the first time, the effect is run
14. A `fetch` request is made to the NASA API
15. When the request data comes back, we set the `imgSrc` state to a piece of the data, which triggers a re-render

```js
  function MartianImageFetcher(props) {
    ...

    useEffect(() => {
      fetch(
        `https://api.nasa.gov/mars-photos/api/v1/rovers/curiosity/photos?earth_date=${
          props.date
        }&api_key=gnesiqnKCJMm8UTYZYi86ZA5RAnrO4TAR9gDstVb`
      )
        .then(res => res.json())
        .then(data => {
          setImgSrc(data.photos[0].img_src);
        });
    }, []);

    ...
  }
```

16. The `MartianImageFetcher` function component is called again
17. `useState` remembers that the `imgSrc` state is set to the data from the API
18. This time, we do **not** queue an effect. We used an empty array (`[]`) as the `useEffect` dependencies argument which means that we only queue effects on the **first** render
19. We do have `imgSrc` state set, so we render the image using the data from the API ðŸŽ‰

```js
  function MartianImageFetcher(props) {
    const [imgSrc, setImgSrc] = useState(null);

    ...

    if (!imgSrc) {
      return null;
    } else {
      return <img src={imgSrc} />;
    }
  }
```

Phew! That was a lot of work just to render an image! But we're not quite done yet, we still need to find out what happens when we click the "Fetch image for 2020" button:

1. In the `App` component, the `handle2020Click` click handler is called
2. The `date` state is set to `"2020-01-01"` and a re-render is triggered
3. The `App` function component is called again and the `date` state is set to `"2020-01-01"`
4. The `date` prop that is passed to `MartianImageFetcher` is **different** which means that it has to re-render

```js
  function App() {
    ...

    function handle2020Click() {
      setDate("2020-01-01");
    }

    ...

    return (
      ...
      <div>
        ...
        <button onClick={handle2020Click}>Fetch image for 2020</button>
        ...
        {date ? <MartianImageFetcher photoDate={date} /> : null}
        ...
      </div>
      ...
    );
  }
```

5. In the `MartianImageFetcher` component `useState` remembers that we already had `imgSrc` state. It is set to the image from 2019
6. Again, we do **not** queue the effect because this is a re-render and `useEffect` has been passed an empty array `[]`
7. Because `imgSrc` state has been set previously we render the image from 2019

```js
  function MartianImageFetcher(props) {
    const [imgSrc, setImgSrc] = useState(null);

    useEffect(() => {
      ...
    }, []);

    return <img src={imgSrc} />;
  }
```

| 1. Did you spot where the bug was? Discuss with a group of 2 - 3 students where you think the bug is. |
| 2. Report back to the rest of the class where you think the bug happened.                             |

The key that the `useEffect` in `MartianImageFetcher` is **only run once**. This is because we told React that the queue should be queued on the first render only. However, as we saw, sometimes you need the effect to run again when some data changes. In this case the `date` prop, changed from `"2019-01-01"` to `"2020-01-01"`, meaning that we have to fetch data different data. We call this a _dependency_ of the effect.

### `useEffect` dependencies array

To solve this problem, we can tell React to queue the effect on the first render **and** when a dependency changes. We do this by adding the dependency variable to the array ([interactive example](https://codesandbox.io/s/fetch-with-prop-updates-working-64vw3?file=/src/App.js)):

```js
function MartianImageFetcher(props) {
  const [imgSrc, setImgSrc] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    ...
  }, [props.photoDate]);

  ...
}
```

Now when the `photoDate` prop changes, React knows that the effect must be run again, this time with the 2020 data. Because of this behaviour, the second argument to `useEffect` is called the _dependencies argument_. We use it whenever we have something in our effect that _depends_ on a variable outside of the effect function.

To help you understand this better, try "playing computer" again, but this time think about what happens when we use `[props.photoDate]` for the dependencies argument. Think carefully about what changes with step 6 after we click the 2020 button.

| Exercise E (estimate: 10 min)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Copy/paste the code from [this CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/bestpokemonselector-component-mdz0o?file=/src/BestPokemonSelector.js) into the new file.                                                                                                                                                       |
| 3. Open `src/App.js` and replace the `PokemonMoves` component with the `PokemonMovesSelector` component (remember to update the `import` too!)                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 4. Take a few minutes to read what the `PokemonMovesSelector` component does. If you have questions, ask a Teaching Assistant to help. We **won't** need to make any more changes to this component.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 5. Open the `PokemonMoves` component again. Change the URL to use backticks (`` `...` ``) instead of double-quotes (`"`). Then replace the number 1 with `${props.pokemonId}`. What will this do? <details><summary>Click here if you don't know</summary>The URL will contain the <code>pokemonId</code> instead of always fetching the Pokemon with id of 1</details> |
| 6. Open your browser and find where the `PokemonMovesSelector` component is rendered. **Before you click the buttons**, think about what you expect will happen. Then click the "Fetch Bulbasaur" button to find out what actually happens.                                                                                                                             |
| 7. Refresh the page. What happens now if you click the "Fetch Bulbasaur" button, then click the "Fetch Charmander" button? Is this what you expected? Explain to someone why this happens.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 8. Fix the bug by adding `props.pokemonId` to the `useEffect` dependencies array in `PokemonMoves`. Remember that you can test if the bug still happens by refreshing the page, clicking one of the buttons, then the other button.                                                                                                                                     |

### ESLint rules for React Hooks

As you may have noticed, VSCode highlighted the empty dependencies array when you changed the URL passed to `fetch` in `PokemonMoves`.

This is because your React application is using the rules from [`eslint-plugin-react-hooks`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks), a package created by the developers who make React. It helps you to find bugs in React Hooks code by highlighting places where you might be missing dependencies.

If you see a red squiggly line underneath your `useEffect` dependencies array, you can hover your mouse over and it will tell you which variable is missing so you can add it to the dependencies array. Here's an example:

<img src={require('!file-loader!../assets/eslint-hooks-rule.png').default}/>

### Loading state

| Exercise F (estimate: 5 min)                                                                                                                                  |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. Open [this CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/fetch-with-prop-updates-working-64vw3?file=/src/App.js).                                                  |
| 2. Click the "Fetch image for 2019" button and wait for the image to load.                                                                                    |
| 3. Now click the "Fetch image for 2020" button. Do you think this is a good experience for the user? Explain what you think is wrong to a Teaching Assistant. |

In the application above, the image from 2020 takes a while to load. This makes it feel like the app is broken: the user might think that they didn't actually click the 2020 button or that it is not working correctly. We are not telling the user that _something_ is happening, it's just taking a bit of time to load.

We can fix this by adding a _loading state_. Let's take a look ([interactive example](https://codesandbox.io/s/fetch-with-loading-state-part-1-7bi9z?file=/src/FetchWithLoadingState.js)):

```js
function MartianImageFetcher(props) {
  ...

  if (!imgSrc) {
    return "Loading...";
  } else {
    return <img src={imgSrc} />;
  }
}
```

Previously, we were just rendering nothing (by returning `null`) when we didn't have any `imgSrc`. We can tell the user that this by instead rendering something telling them that we're still waiting for the data to come back.

There is still a problem though: when we click to fetch another image, we still have `imgSrc` set to the previous image. What we could do instead is set the `imgSrc` back to `null` when we know that we're fetching another image ([interactive example](https://codesandbox.io/s/fetch-with-loading-state-part-2-dvu6k?file=/src/FetchWithLoadingState.js)):

```js
function MartianImageFetcher(props) {
  ...

  useEffect(() => {
    setImgSrc(null);

    ...
  }, [props.date]);

  ...
}
```

| Exercise G (estimate: 5 min)                                                                                                                                                   |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Open the `pokedex` React application again and open the `src/PokemonMoves.js` file.                                                                                         |
| 2. In the `PokemonMoves` component, instead of returning `null` if there is no `pokemonData`, return `"Loading..."`.                                                           |
| 3. Now add `setPokemonData(null)` inside the `useEffect` callback, before the call to `fetch`.                                                                                 |
| 4. Try clicking on the "Fetch Bulbasaur" and "Fetch Charmander" buttons quickly. Do you see the loading state? (It may only appear for a flash, the Pokemon API is very fast). |

## Working with forms in React

Modern web applications often involve interacting with forms such as creating an account, adding a blog post or posting a comment. This would involve using inputs, buttons and various form elements and being able to get the values entered by users to do something with it (like display them on a page or send them in a POST request). So, how do we do this in React?

A popular pattern for building forms and collect user data is the _controlled component_ pattern. A _pattern_ is a repeated solution to a problem that is useful in multiple similar cases. Let's have a look at an example ([interactive example](https://codesandbox.io/s/controlled-component-4jq1yqy8kx?file=/src/SimpleReminder.js)):

```js
function SimpleReminder() {
  const [reminder, setReminder] = useState("");

  function handleChange(event) {
    setReminder(event.target.value);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="text"
        placeholder="Some reminder"
        value={reminder}
        onChange={handleChange}
      />
      <p>Today I need to remember to... {reminder}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

We're controlling the `value` of the input by using the value from the `reminder` state. This means that we can only change the value by updating the state.

It is done using the `onChange` attribute and the `handleChange` function which is called every time the input value changes (typically when a new character is added or removed).

If we didn't call `setReminder` in the `handleChange` function, then the input's value would never change and it would appear as if you couldn't type in the input! Finally, the value we keep in the `reminder` state is displayed on the screen as today's reminder.

In addition, instead of just saving the value of the input in the state, we could have also transformed the string before we set it with `setReminder`, for example by calling `toUpperCase()` on the string.

### Form with Multiple Fields

Let's have a look at a more complex example where we want to build a form to let users enter information to create a personal account ([interactive example](https://codesandbox.io/s/controlled-component-createaccountform-m7p083zn6p?file=/src/CreateAccountForm.js)):

```js
function CreateAccountForm() {
  const [userData, setUserData] = useState({
    username: "",
    email: "",
    password: "",
  });

  function handleChange(event) {
    const updatedUserData = {
      ...userData,
      [event.target.name]: event.target.value,
    };

    setUserData(updatedUserData);
  }

  function submit() {
    console.log("Do something with the form values...");
    console.log(`Username = ${userData.username}`);
    console.log(`Email = ${userData.email}`);
    console.log(`Password = ${userData.password}`);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <input
          type="text"
          name="username"
          placeholder="Username"
          value={userData.username}
          onChange={handleChange}
        />
      </div>
      <div>
        <input
          type="text"
          name="email"
          placeholder="Email"
          value={userData.email}
          onChange={handleChange}
        />
      </div>
      <div>
        <input
          type="password"
          name="password"
          placeholder="Password"
          value={userData.password}
          onChange={handleChange}
        />
      </div>
      <button type="submit" onClick={submit}>
        Create account
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

We now have three different inputs named `username`, `email` and `password`, and we keep each entered value in state as a field in an object. The method `handleChange` is reused to keep track of changes for **all** the values. The trick here is to use the `name` of the `<input>` element to update the corresponding state.

#### Updating an Object in State

Did you spot the strange syntax in `handleChange`?

We are using [object spread](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax#Spread_in_object_literals) syntax, which copies properties from one object to another. We are using this to update the state object but without _mutating_ the original object.

Let's break this down into 2 steps. Here we create a **new** object based on another object, and **adding** a new property ([interactive example](https://jsbin.com/suyekiwezu/edit?js,console)):

```js
const sherlock = {
  name: "Sherlock Holmes",
};

const sherlockAfterMoving = {
  ...sherlock,
  address: "221b Baker Street",
};

console.log(sherlock);
console.log(sherlockAfterMoving);
```

We can also _override_ a property if the keys are the same ([interactive example](https://jsbin.com/hiwuwobeza/edit?js,console)):

```js
const watson = {
  name: "John Watson",
  address: "123 Fake Road",
};

const watsonAfterMoving = {
  ...watson,
  address: "221b Baker Street",
};

console.log(watson);
console.log(watsonAfterMoving);
```

Notice how Watson "moves" from "123 Fake Road" to "221b Baker Street"? Because the `address` key is in both objects, the **second** one "wins" and overrides the other key.

The second bit of new syntax (`[event.target.name]`) is called a _computed property name_. Inside a JavaScript object, you can use a variable wrapped in square brackets which acts as a dynamic key, such as ([interactive example](https://jsbin.com/jegerohati/edit?js,console)):

```js
const theKey = "hat";
const theValue = "Deerstalker Cap";

const sherlockClothes = {
  [theKey]: theValue,
};

console.log(sherlockClothes); // => { hat: "Deerstalker Cap" }
```

We are combining all of the concepts above to make a new object, that has all the same properties as the `userData` object, except for the property that is computed from `event.target.name` for the key and `event.target.value` for the value.

| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Open the `pokedex` React application again and open the `src/CaughtPokemon.js` file. In this exercise, instead of recording the number of caught Pokemon, we are going to record the names of each Pokemon you caught.                                               |
| 2. Render an `<input>` before the `<button>` (hint: `<input type="text" />`).                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 3. Create a new state variable called `pokemonNameInput` and initialise to an empty string (`""`).                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 4. Add a `value` property to the `<input>` which passes the `pokemonNameInput` state variable.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 5. Create a new `handleInputChange` function.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 6. Add a `onChange` handler to the `<input>` that will call `handleInputChange`.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 7. Add a parameter called `event` to the `handleInputChange` function and add a `console.log` with `event.target.value`. In your browser, try writing something in the `<input>`. What do you see in the JavaScript console?                                            |
| 8. Set the `pokemonNameInput` state variable to `event.target.value`. In your browser, try writing something in the `<input>`. What do you see?                                                                                                                         |
| 9. We are now going to save the user input when clicking on the `<button>`. Change the `caughtPokemon` state variable so that it is initialised as an empty array `[]`.                                                                                                 |
| 10. There should now be a bug in your app! The number of caught Pokemon has gone! To fix it, change from rendering `caughtPokemon` to `caughtPokemon.length`. Why did this fix the bug?                                                                                 |
| 11. We now need to change the `catchPokemon` function to add the `pokemonNameInput` state variable into the `caughtPokemon` array. (Hint: trying using the `.concat()` method, then calling `setCaughtPokemon`).                                                        |
| 12. Open your browser, type a Pokemon name into the `<input>` and click on the "Catch Pokemon" button. Can you see the number of caught Pokemon incrementing as you click on the button?                                                                                |
| 13. Now we are going to display the names of the caught Pokemon. Instead of rendering `caughtPokemon.length`, create a `<ul>` element and use the `.map()` method on the `caughtPokemon` state variable to loop over each Pokemon and return a `<li>` element for each. |
| 14. Empty the `<input>` after clicking on the button. To do this, set the state of `pokemonNameInput` to an empty string `""` after we have added it to the `caughtPokemon` array in the `catchPokemon` function.                                                       |
| 14: **(STRETCH GOAL)** Make sure the user cannot add a Pokemon to the `caughtPokemon` state if the value of `pokemonNameInput` state is empty.                                                                                                                          |

## Further Reading

### Container components

In real world applications, the things we want to remember in state follow the [_business logic_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_logic) required by our users. So for example the number of caught Pokemon in the exercise increases when you click on the button _Catch Pokemon_. Most of the time, business logic is about figuring out when and how to change state.

To help us cleanly split up code that performs business logic from code that shows the user interface, we split components into _presentational_ and _container_ components. Often we have components that don't do anything except manage state according to the business rules and render the right presentational components. On the other hand, we often have components that don't change any state, and just render using the provided props.

Container components usually have some state and handler methods, while presentational components usually just receive props and render JSX using these props.
